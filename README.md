# Customer Lifetime Value Analysis

This repository contains a Python exploratory data analysis and visualization project focused on Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) analysis. The project utilizes the pandas, plotly, and seaborn libraries for data cleaning and visualization.

## Data

The data used in this project is stored in the CSV file `customer_acquisition_data.csv`. The CSV file contains the following attributes:

- `customer_id`: Unique identifier for each customer
- `channel`: Marketing channel through which the customer was acquired
- `cost`: Acquisition cost for each customer
- `conversion_rate`: Conversion rate for each customer
- `revenue`: Revenue generated by each customer

## Analysis and Visualization

The main analysis and visualization code can be found in the Jupyter Notebook `customer_Analysis.ipynb`. This notebook includes the code for data cleaning, exploration, and visualization using the provided data.

### Key Analysis Points:

1. **Revenue generated by customer**: Analysis of revenue generated by each customer.
2. **Customer Acquisition cost by Channel**: Visualization of acquisition cost by marketing channel.
3. **Revenue generated by each Channel**: Analysis of revenue generated by each marketing channel.
4. **Conversion Rate by Channel**: Visualization of conversion rate by marketing channel.
5. **Return on Investment by Channel**: Analysis of return on investment by marketing channel.

## How to Use

To run the analysis and visualization code:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed (`pandas`, `plotly`).
3. Open and run the `customer_Analysis.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

Feel free to explore and modify the code to suit your specific analysis needs!
